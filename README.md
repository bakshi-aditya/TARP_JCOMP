Face Recognition and Liveness Detection Attendance System
This project was developed as part of the TARP (Technical Answers to Real World Problems) CSE1902. It aims to revolutionize attendance tracking methods by integrating face recognition and liveness detection technologies.

Project Description
The system uses face recognition technology to identify individuals and mark their attendance. It leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately identify individuals from a database of known faces. The system is robust to variations in lighting, pose, and facial expressions, ensuring high recognition accuracy.

To enhance security, the system also incorporates a liveness detection component. This feature distinguishes between real faces and fake ones (e.g., photos, videos, or masks), ensuring that the attendance system cannot be easily manipulated.

Key Features
Automated Attendance Tracking: Replaces traditional attendance tracking methods, saving time and reducing errors.
Face Recognition: Accurately identifies individuals from a database of known faces.
Liveness Detection: Prevents spoofing attacks by distinguishing between real faces and fake ones.
Real-Time Processing: Capable of processing images in real-time for immediate attendance tracking.
User-Friendly Interface: Requires minimal interaction from the users.
